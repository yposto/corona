Overview
This project investigates the correlation between COVID-19 infection outcomes (recovery or death) and key demographic factors such as gender and age.

Goals
Analyze mortality rates among male and female COVID-19 patients.

Investigate the relationship between age and mortality.

Visualize patterns and insights using graphs and plots.

Methods
Data Cleaning: Handled missing values and filtered confirmed COVID-19 cases.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Analyzed demographic distributions and mortality patterns.

Feature Engineering: Created new features, such as 'age above 60', to enhance analysis.

Data Visualization: Plotted graphs using Matplotlib and Seaborn to highlight findings.

Tools Used
Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn)

Jupyter Notebook

Key Insights
Gender and age significantly influence mortality rates among COVID-19 patients.

Older age groups had higher mortality rates compared to younger groups.
